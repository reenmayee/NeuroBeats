🔷 1. Frontend UI/UX (React.js)
🎯 Goal: Let user upload song → play it → remix it → view waveform → download.
Upload Interface
UI: Upload button to select an audio file (input type="file").
Store uploaded file in local state.
Generate audio URL using URL.createObjectURL().
Audio Preview Player
Show uploaded song name.
Build a custom audio player:
▶ Play / ⏸ Pause
⏮ Replay button
Timeline (optional)

Effect Options UI
Buttons:
🎶 Slowed + Reverb
🎧 8D Audio
🫧 Lo-fi Remix

On click → send request to backend to generate the remix.
Audio Waveform Visualizer
Use wavesurfer.js or p5.js to show sound waves while playing.
Sync it with play/pause.
Download Button
After remix is generated by backend, provide a download button for user.
GenAI Remix Name Suggestion
Display fun remix names like “Lo-fi Heartbreak Edition”.
This will be generated by GenAI based on song name + effect.

🔷 2. Backend (Node.js + Express + Python + CUDA)
🎯 Goal: Receive audio file → process with effect (via CUDA Python) → return new audio
Receive Song File
API endpoint: /upload
Accept file via multer (or similar).
Apply Audio Effect
On API like /remix/:type
Use Python backend with CUDA acceleration for fast rendering:
Slowed + Reverb (use librosa, pydub, etc.)
8D Audio (pan & reverb)
Lo-fi Remix (low pass filters + vinyl crackle)
Save the processed audio temporarily.
Return Processed Audio
API response: link to remixed audio file.
Host audio file on backend using Express static folder.
Remix Name Generation (GenAI)
API: /generate-remix-name
Input: song name + selected effect
Output: creative remix title
Use OpenAI or Hugging Face API for this.

🔷 3. Cloud & Storage

Temp Storage (Local FS)
For development: save processed audio in uploads/ or output/ folders.
Production (Cloud optional)
Host remixed audio on AWS S3 or Firebase Storage.
Generate time-limited download URLs.
